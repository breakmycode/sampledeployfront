How to deploy a website ?
(see img dlp1im)
ans-- deploy could b either in fronmtend or backend 
-- for the frontend deployment , we have static hosts and HTML hosting 
-- for the frontend+backend or anywhere there is backend there 
servers+cloud hosting+ VPS(virtual private service)  is required
 
-- now , Backend hosting coulnt be done  for free vbeacuse it requires CPU+RAM+Disk+bandwidth
whereas frontend deploying only requires bandwidth ... 
maximum space it could use , it could be 10MB.as it is only HTML+JS+CSS code. 


==> Bare metal 
==> Infrastructure as a service (Iaas)
types of Iaas services:
AWS-- amazon web services
GCE-- Google clouyd Engine

PLATFORM AS A SERVICE::
-- we are a virtual computer , the computer has Ubuntu+Node.js+npm installed in it
u just provide us a Git repo , we will clone 
-- then we will npm install
-- our responsibility is just to manage the source code
-- put it into git , the service providers , they put it into the git 
-- they install and they run it .
-- this type of service is known as Platform as a service(Paas)

-- in Paas, all the things exits like Os and all 
example : Heroku
we will give the source code to heroku and it will run our code.

-- on Github also , if u publish ur frontend code , github can host frontend for u 
coding blocks is actually hosted on github only..
-- if we goto hackerblocks.com or online.codingblocks.com, they are Iaas-- means they are bot servers on cloud 


-- lets say we we start with frontend only website..
-- create an html
